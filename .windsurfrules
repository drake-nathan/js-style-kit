# Overview

- This is a monorepo managed with Turborepo and Bun
- It is to maintain an npm package which is a style guide for ESLint and Prettier called `js-style-kit`
- The main source code is in `packages/style-kit/`

## Docs

- Documentation is in `docs/`, this is a Mintlify site
- The readme at the root is just for Github. It gives a brief overview of the project, and a map of the repo
- The read at `packages/style-kit/README.md` is the npm documentation for the package

## Workflow

- Use bun for all commands
- Use the ESLint mcp to fix linting issues
